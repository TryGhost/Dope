# Greymuzzle Code of Conduct

Greymuzzle is a journalism project covering the furry fandom.  
We exist to make the fandom safer & more informed!

This Code of Conduct explains how we expect people to behave when they:

- Contribute to this repository (code, design, docs, issues, PRs)
- Collaborate on Greymuzzle editorial work (planning, drafting, fact-checking)
- Interact in any official Greymuzzle spaces (GitHub, chats, project tools, etc.)

If you want to work on Greymuzzle, you’re agreeing to these standards.

---

## 1. Core Values

Greymuzzle is explicitly:

- **Anti-fascist**
- **Pro-survivor**
- **Pro-worker**
- **Queer- and trans-inclusive**
- **Furry-centric**

We try to be:

- Evidence-based and honest  
- Trauma-informed and careful  
- Curious, not cruel  
- Critical of systems, not dismissive of people’s humanity

---

## 2. Who this applies to

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- Project maintainers
- Contributors (code and editorial)
- Volunteers, collaborators, and advisors
- Anyone participating in Greymuzzle-managed spaces

Maintainers are held to a *higher* standard, not a lower one.

---

## 3. Expected behavior

You don’t have to be perfect. You do have to be responsible.

We expect contributors to:

- **Treat people with basic respect**
  - No slurs, dehumanizing language, or targeted mockery of identity
  - Disagree with ideas; don’t attack people
- **Center survivors and vulnerable people**
  - Take disclosures seriously
  - Don’t pressure anyone to share more than they want
- **Respect boundaries and privacy**
  - Don’t post DMs, private logs, or identifying info without explicit consent
  - Keep sensitive evidence in secure channels, not public repos
- **Collaborate in good faith**
  - Keep discussion focused on the work
  - Assume mistakes are fixable, not moral failures
- **Accept feedback**
  - Be open to edits, reviews, and “no” as an answer
  - If you’re called in or called out, take a breath and listen

For maintainers specifically:

- Be transparent about decisions
- Apply rules consistently
- Step back from issues where you have a conflict of interest

---

## 4. Unacceptable behavior

The following are not tolerated in any Greymuzzle context:

### 4.1 Bigotry & hate

- Racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia
- Homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, acephobia
- Ableism, misogyny, fatphobia, classism
- Nazi / fascist apologism, “ironic” fascism, or far-right organizing
- “Jokes” or dogwhistles that rely on any of the above

### 4.2 Harassment & abuse

- Targeted insults or threats
- Repeated unwanted contact after being asked to stop
- Stalking, doxxing, or encouraging others to harass someone
- Using Greymuzzle spaces to settle personal vendettas

### 4.3 Exploiting trauma & sensitive topics

- Pressuring survivors to share details
- Sharing graphic material without content warnings
- Publishing or handling evidence in ways that put people at risk

### 4.4 NSFW and boundaries

Greymuzzle may cover NSFW topics in reporting. Even so:

- No explicit sexual content in project repos, issues, or dev chats (This is mostly a GitHub thing, but lets try to keep it sfw generally unless absolutely necessary)
- No sexualization of minors or “youth-coded” characters
- No kink roleplay or explicit flirting in project spaces

### 4.5 Misuse of Greymuzzle’s name or tools

- Using Greymuzzle’s name or infrastructure to:
  - Harass people
  - Run personal callout campaigns
  - Push fascist or hate-based narratives
 
### 4.6 Anything not covered here
- Don't be mean. You know what "mean" is. Don't be rude, and don't be obnxious and obtuse either. If you know what you did, don't play dumb.
- This rule acts as a catch-all for anything not otherwise specified. Nic Weyand has final say.

## 5. Reporting problems

If you experience or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct, you can:

- Use whatever **official contact channels** are listed in the live project/docs  
  (for example: a dedicated email address or reporting form)
- Or reach out directly to a maintainer listed in this repo (if you feel safe doing so)

When you report, it helps (but is not required) to include:

- What happened (plain-language summary)
- Where it happened (link, screenshot, or context)
- When it occurred
- Who was involved, and whether you’re comfortable naming them
- Whether you want your identity kept confidential

We will:

- Take reports seriously
- Respect your requested level of confidentiality as much as we realistically can
- Prioritize the safety of reporters and vulnerable people over the comfort of those in power

---

## 6. Enforcement

Possible responses to a Code of Conduct violation include (but aren’t limited to):

- A private conversation and reminder of expectations
- Written warning
- Reverting or blocking contributions
- Temporary or permanent ban from:
  - This repo
  - Related project spaces (chat, docs, etc.)
- Public statement clarifying boundaries or correcting misinformation

Serious cases (e.g. threats, fascist organizing, doxxing, sexualization of minors) may result in **immediate removal** from Greymuzzle spaces without prior warning.

Project maintainers will:

- Use their best judgment and available information
- Consider the pattern of behavior, not just single incidents
- Recuse themselves if they are directly involved in the conflict

---

## 7. Conflicts of interest

Because Greymuzzle reports on real people and events, conflicts of interest matter.

You are expected to **disclose** when:

- You are staff/volunteer at a convention, group, or org we might cover
- You are close friends, partners, or housemates with someone involved
- You have a financial stake in an outcome

Disclosure does not automatically disqualify you from contributing, but:

- You may be asked to step back from specific decisions or stories
- You should not use Greymuzzle access to protect friends or attack enemies

---

## 8. Changes to this Code

This Code of Conduct is a living document.

We may update it:

- As Greymuzzle grows
- As we learn more about what our community needs
- In response to gaps exposed by real incidents

Substantive changes will be discussed in public (issues or docs), not snuck in quietly.

---

## 9. Attribution

This Code of Conduct is informed by:

- The general spirit of the Contributor Covenant
- Common newsroom ethics and safety practices
- Lived experience in fandom spaces

It’s written specifically for Greymuzzle’s context and values.

---

If you’re unsure whether something is okay, assume this:  
**If it puts vulnerable people at risk, undermines trust, or advances fascist or hateful ideas, it doesn’t belong here.**
